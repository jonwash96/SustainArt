                    <p class="about-bodycopy">The latter part of the 20th century saw a dramatic shift in the art world, particularly in New York City. The avant-garde art scene was thriving, with artists like Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Keith Haring leading the way. These artists, who would become known as some of the most influential figures of the post-modern era, were pushing the boundaries of what was considered art, and exploring new and innovative ways to express their ideas and perspectives. Their works were bold, graphic, and often politically charged, reflecting the cultural and social upheaval of the time.
                    <br><br>
                    In the decades since, art has continued to evolve and expand, exploring new mediums and techniques and embracing new technologies. One of the biggest challenges facing artists today is sustainability. With the planet facing unprecedented environmental and social challenges, artists are being called upon to use their voices and their art to help raise awareness and drive change.</p>

                    <p class="about-bodycopy">Andy Warhol was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, often referred to as the “Pope of Pop Art.” He was born in Pittsburgh in 1928 and began his artistic career as a commercial illustrator before moving to New York in the 1950s. Warhol is best known for his colorful, bold and often controversial depictions of American popular culture, such as Campbell’s soup cans, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley. He also experimented with film, music and performance art, and was a key figure in the 1960s art scene in New York.</p>

                    <p class="about-bodycopy">Jean-Michel Basquiat was a rising star in the New York art world of the 1980s. Born in Brooklyn in 1960, he was a self-taught artist who began his career as a graffiti writer and later gained recognition for his distinctive style, combining elements of primitive, abstract, and figural art. Basquiat’s works are marked by a raw energy, social commentary, and a critique of power, race, and class. He quickly gained international recognition and was sought after by leading galleries and collectors. Sadly, Basquiat died at the young age of 27, but his legacy lives on as one of the most important and influential artists of his generation.</p>

                    <p class="about-bodycopy">Keith Haring was a visionary artist and activist who rose to prominence in the 1980s. Born in Pennsylvania in 1958, he was inspired by the New York street art scene and began creating his own works using chalk on black paper in subway stations. Haring’s bold, simple, and graphic style quickly caught the attention of the art world, and he went on to create large-scale public murals, exhibitions, and commercial products. He was also deeply committed to social activism, using his art to address issues of war, AIDS, and other political and social issues. His impact on contemporary art continues to be felt today, and he is remembered as a cultural icon of the 20th century.</p>

            <h3>The Designer</h3>
            <p class="body-copy">Hi, I’m JON. I’m much more of an ideas person than just a painter-by-feel or an artist who’s really good at replicating what he see’s thru his chosen medium or one who can just come up with really creative imagery without any sort of evident inspiration. I have a formal post-secondary education in Design, which of course includes an art background, but is tailored more toward problem-solving, but even in that, I’ve always had more of a knack for ideas in process and information, moreso than pure visuals and aesthetics. So my artform is more about the abstract what as opposed to the concrete what, but through that, I come up with and utilize different processes to create visually stunning work, but visually stunning work that is deeply rooted in the information and concept that it comes from.
            <br>
            So with my particular artist style, one Idea I've has is to use this new, cutting edge thing, which puts the value of art and what it means to be an artist this day in age in question, and provide to that qualm an answer in the form of a work of art which utilises it as a tool in an artistically responsible way to aid my process without substituting it as my practice.</p>
